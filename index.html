          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <h3>Before Programming There was Physics</h3>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/600x600" alt="First Last Name" title="First Last Name">
          <p>My background is in physics. I went to college for physics. Got a degree in physics. I went to graduate school for physics. I got my doctorate in physics. I love physics, or so I thought. During my graduate work I slowly came to the realization that it was not physics itself that I deeply enjoyed and was pursuing. What I enjoyed was solving problems, and equally as important, making a difference that I could feel.</p>
          <p>In college I felt a great sense of accomplishment when I solved a tough problem. This was felt even more so when in graduate school. Graduate school was incredibly tough; 70-100+ hour weeks of learning and solving incredibly complex physics problems that always seemed to require skills beyond my own. It was miserable and rewarding, tiring and worth it. It was the difficulty that made it the work appealing, the teamwork with my cohort that made it better, and the sense of accomplishment that kept coming back for more.</p>
          <p>After 2&frac12; years of intense graduate physics courses, they were over. Graduate research was underway and a new mode was switched on. This part lasted 3 years and over that time I slowly drifted away from physics. Research was a different animal. Research was slow and steady. Research was wide open, so wide open it was paralyzing at times. Accomplishments didn't arise nearly as often, and they felt nowhere near as rewarding as they did during coursework.</p>
            <p>Over time I realized that it wasn't physics that was drawing me to the work, it was that sense of accomplishment of a difficult task. It was the satisfaction of knowing that I got it right. I drifted away from physics and searched for another outlet to fill this need.</p>
          <p>I had only a handful of opportunities to experience programming as a graduate student. The needed arose to learn LabVIEW, a graphical user interface for communicating with scientific equipment processing its data. Self-taught, I interfaced with thermocouples, pneumatic valves, a quartz crystal microbalance, mass flow controllers - tools needed for high vacuum deposition systems. I utilized complex precedural programming to automate the precise control of flow of different compounds to grow this films on the nanometer scale. Now a process that required constant, unblinking attention for anywhere from 2 to 48 hours... was able to run on its own to completion. I loved it.</p>
          <p>As a teaching assistant I learned VPython and developed physics simulation projects for honors students to develop and explore. I models simple physics principles including conservation of energy and momentum, angular momentum, springs, gravity, pendula, and more. Again, I loved it. I developed my skills at teaching and programming in conjuction.</p>
          <p>Throughout both my research and teaching experiences, I utilized a high-level mathematical programming language, <i>Mathematica</i>. I used it for everything I could, from automating repetitive homework sets to batch renaming hundreds of research data files. I modeled several physical concepts and constructed several statistical mechanics Monte Carlo simulations with it. <i>Mathematica</i> was my go-to tool to making my life that much easier.</p>
          <p>These were the experiences through which I discovered my passion for programming. It was that feeling of knowing that my efforts were used to do good. It was that almost primal satisfaction I got from solving a problem and knowing that my efforts were not all for naught. </p>
          <h3>Then There was Programming</h3>
          <p>By the time I graduated with a Ph.D. in Physics, I knew I did not want to be a physicist at heart. I looked back on my time spent studying the fundamentals of the universe to find moments that I enjoyed most. I discovered those moments alwayscentered around programming, logic puzzles, and computing in general. These were the tasks I found myself ablt to work endlessly until complete, without awareness of the clock, and I truly enjoyed them. It is unfortunate it took this long to figure it out, but fortunate that it was.</p>
          <p>After graduation some time complating this tremendous decision to leave physics and ultimately did. I worked for one year as the Director of Tutoring at a rising tutoring company focused teaching the fundamentals and not the solutions through one-on-one interactions tailored to each student's needs.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile I narrowed strategy to learning web development and choose to enroll in <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. For six months I studied at Launch School during every spare moment I had. It became that this was a passion of mine so I quit my job to study at Launch School full-time. Now almost one year into the program I look back and can safely say that programming is where I belong.</p>
          <p>Please explore this site and see what I have accomplished in my one year of learning. Think I have potential? I actively looking for a position in web development and would love to hear about opportunities. Please send me an email.</p>
