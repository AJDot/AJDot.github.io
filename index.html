            <section>
            <h3>Before Programming There was Physics</h3>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/600x600" alt="First Last Name" title="First Last Name">
            <p>My background is in physics. I went to college for physics. Got a degree in physics. I went to graduate school for physics. I got my doctorate in physics. I love physics, or so I thought. During my graduate work I slowly came to the realization that it was not physics itself that I was pursuing. What I enjoyed was solving problems, and equally as important, making a difference that I could feel. Physics did a phenomenal job of the former but fell short in the latter.</p>
            <p>In college I felt a great sense of accomplishment when I solved a tough problem. This was felt even more so when in graduate school. Graduate school was tough - 70-100+ hour weeks of learning and solving complex physics problems that always seemed to require skills beyond my own. It was miserable and rewarding, tiring and worth it. It was the difficulty that made the work appealing, the teamwork with my cohort that made it better, and the sense of accomplishment that kept coming back for more.</p>
            <p>After 2&frac12; years of intense courses, they were over. Graduate research was underway and a new mode of operation had begun. It was a side of physics I hadn't truly experienced before (I had a short research experience as an undergraduate that didn't quite do the field justice). Research was a different animal. It was slow and steady and wide open, so wide open it was paralyzing at times. Accomplishments didn't arise nearly as often, and they felt nowhere near as rewarding when they did. My research lasted 3 years and over that time I drifted away from physics.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>I needed to find something else</h3>
            <p>Over time I realized that it wasn't physics that was drawing me to the work, it was that sense of accomplishment. I drifted away from physics (research in particular) and searched for another outlet to fill this need.</p>
            <p>I had only a handful of opportunities to experience programming as a graduate student. The needed arose to learn LabVIEW, a graphical user interface for communicating with scientific equipment and processing data. Self-taught, I interfaced with thermocouples, pneumatic valves, a quartz crystal microbalance, mass flow controllers - tools needed for high vacuum deposition systems. I utilized complex precedural programming to automate the precise control of flow of different compounds to grow nanomater scale thin films. Now, a process that required constant, unblinking attention for anywhere from 2 to 48 hours... was able to run unassisted to completion. I loved it.</p>
            <p>As a teaching assistant I learned VPython and developed physics simulation projects for honors students to build and explore. I modeled simple physics principles including conservation of energy and momentum, angular momentum, springs, gravity, pendula, etc. Again, I loved it. I developed my skills at teaching and programming in conjuction.</p>
            <p>Throughout both my research and teaching experiences, I utilized a high-level mathematical programming language, <i>Mathematica</i>. I used it for everything I could, from automating repetitive homework sets to batch renaming hundreds of research data files. I modeled several physical concepts and constructed several statistical mechanics Monte Carlo simulations with it. <i>Mathematica</i> was my go-to tool to making my life that much easier.</p>
            <p>Through these experiences I discovered my passion for programming. It fulfilled all of my needs; it required complex logical skills, it gave me an almost immediate sense of satisfaction, and I could see without doubt that my efforts weren't all for naught. Programming hit all the marks.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Then There was Programming</h3>
            <p>By the time I graduated with my Ph.D. in Physics, I knew I did not want to be a physicist. I looked back on my time spent studying the fundamentals of the universe to try and find moments that I enjoyed most. I discovered those moments always centered around programming, logic puzzles, and computing in general. These were the tasks I found myself able to work on endlessly to completion, without awareness of the clock, and I truly enjoyed them. It is unfortunate it took this long to figure it out, but fortunate that it happened at all.</p>
            <p>After graduation I spent some time complating this tremendous decision to drop everything I had worked towards the past 10 years and leave physics. Ultimately I did. I worked for one year as the Director of Tutoring at a rising tutoring company that was focused on teaching the fundamentals and not the solutions through one-on-one interactions tailored to each student's needs.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I narrowed my strategy to learning web development and chose to enroll in <a href="https://launchschool.com" class="inline-anchor">Launch School</a>. For six months I studied at Launch School during every spare moment I had. It became apparent that this was a passion of mine so I quit my job to study at Launch School full-time. Now almost one year into the program I look back and can safely say that programming is where I belong.</p>
